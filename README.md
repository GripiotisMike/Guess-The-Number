# Guess the Number Game ðŸŽ²

- In this Project I learned about the difference between Global and Local Scope/Variables!

A fun Python-based number guessing game where you try to guess a number between 1 and 100 with a limited number of attempts.

## Features
- Choose between two difficulty levels: Easy (10 lives) or Hard (5 lives).
- Get feedback on whether your guess is too high or too low.
- Track how many lives you have left before you lose.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository or download the script.
2. Run the script in a terminal:
   ```bash
   main.py
